Cocktail bar website

I did a master in grid layout with Udemy and when I finished it, I decided to create a website with a different design. The final look should was modern and elegant.
When I designed the website, I had in mind the client all time because a cocktail bar website have a specific neccesity. 
A simple design that recall the exotic, elegance and a bit rich and where it was care the localitation, the menu, and the contact with the objective that the client visit de bar.
